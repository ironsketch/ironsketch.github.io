##OS Project Proposal##
##Neural Networks and Deep Learning##
##Michelle Bergin##
##January 2018##
###1 Overview
My ultimate end goal is to replicate human emotions so that we can better understand our selves. For this
project it’s to have a deep learning machine demonstrate visually, emotions related to words and colors. In
order to achieve this goal (whether it be during my time at Evergreen or later) I will need to research neural
networks, and deep learning. I will need to have a database of the English language, and books. I will also
need to create a survey where I can get people to associate feelings with words and colors. This info would
also be fed to my machine. This is a BIG project. So I will be breaking it up into steps. My goal is not to
do everything but to feel confident in what I have learned and accomplish some of these steps.
###2 Why
I was born with depression, I grew up with AIWS (Alice in Wonderland Syndrome), and as an adult I
deal with anxiety and a learning disorder. The human mind has always interested me. I started reading a
neuropsychologist Oliver Sacks as young as 10. My goal is to help others with anything considered neurodivergent.
But my passion isn’t within the realm of one-on-one discussions with patients. Nor is my passion
in brain surgery. My passion is anything dealing with computers, electronics, programming. This is why I
want to learn how to mimic (on a small scale) the human mind. I want to learn WHY we make our choices.
How do colors effect our word choices and emotions. Also a silly scifi goal I have is to be able to upload my
consciousness so that I can live ’forever’. To achieve this goal I need to help with the advancement of AI,
thus I need to learn neural networks.
###3 Research
I will need to read a LOT of tutorials, documents and research papers on neural networks and deep learning.
This will take up a lot of my time. I will then make my own write up on what I have learned. I want to do
this to instill my knew learned knowledge and to write it in such a way that is accessible to someone else
who would like to learn as I did. This is a HUGE subject and I find it sincerely daunting. I want to help
others feel more confident when they take their first steps into the chaos that is Deep Learning. I purchased
a book written by a former Evergreen student, published by MIT press. I will be using this book as a major
part of my learning. http://www.deeplearningbook.org/. This book is very in depth and I am going to have
to learn linear algebra to understand it.
###4 Plug and Play Duplication
When I feel confident with my knowledge and when I have a better idea of what I need to get started, I will
find a neural network plug and play tutorial. In other words, I will find a getting started tutorial in which
1
most to all the parts are provided that I can replicate. This is important so that I can actually get my feet
dirty. I can actually see how a neural network works and in the future will be able to modify it to meet my
needs. The reason I will be doing a neural network and not a deep learning tutorial is because there are very
few deep learning tutorials that look like I could feel confident accomplishing. With TensorFlows website I
feel confident I could create a deliverable.
###5 Data Collection: Books
I need to get permissions to submit books to my neural network. More than likely I do not see this being
an issue with the multitude of free public domain books.
###6 My Own Neural Network
During this step I will feel confident enough with my knowledge of neural networks that I will create my own
to process something simple like word associations based on locality. At this point I will have my database
of English words, and I will have books that I will have my neural network process. In these books colors
are used, I will create an algorithm to find words near colors and create associations. Before I move on from
this step I want to be able to demonstrate visually (beautifully) the data procduced by this.
###7 Data Collection: Word Associations
I need to create a survey where I get input from as many people as possible on their association of words,
colors and feelings. Making the survey will be easy, surveymonkey and paper. Getting users is the hard
part. I assume I will walk the halls of the school, ask friends, families, etc. Maybe I can even use one of
Amazons sources for paying people pennies for filling out my surveys. I used to do them. I believe it’s

###8 Deep Learning or More Neural Networks?
Finally I want to implement more neural networks or deep learning in order to implement associations of
feelings with words and colors from my data collection above. This may be done with only neural networks
but it may require ’hidden’ networks in a deep learning environment. At this point I may need to actually
use AWS services or build my own machine. AWS would cost up to 100 dollars a month and building a deep
learning machine can cost anywhere from 1000 - 7000 dollars. So this final step may be financially unfeasible.
