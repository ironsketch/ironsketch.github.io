I finally got started on my OS Labs. So I was able to finish part2. It was fun to figure out what I need to bmake etc. 

I made a new folder, hell. I made a new c file hell.c and I copied and modified the Makefile that was in the example so I could learn how to edit that. ALSO I needed to update the Makefile in the root of my-testbin.

hell.c (my-testbin/hell)
{% highlight c %}
/* Michelle Bergin
 * Test Hello World
 */

#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
   printf("HELLo World...\n");
   return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %} 

Makefile (my-testbin/hell)
{% highlight makefile %}
TOP=../../..
.include "$(TOP)/mk/os161.config.mk"

PROG=hell
SRCS=$(PROG).c

BINDIR=/my-testbin

.include "$(TOP)/mk/os161.prog.mk"
{% endhighlight %}

Makefile (my-testbin)
{% highlight makefile %}
TOP=../..
.include "$(TOP)/mk/os161.config.mk"

# Just add new directories at the end of the line below.
SUBDIRS= example
SUBDIRS= hell

.include "$(TOP)/mk/os161.subdir.mk"
{% endhighlight %}
