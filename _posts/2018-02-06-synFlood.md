In Networking class in DeterLab we get to create 4 servers. A Website Server, an attacker, a client and router. I created a bash script to continuelly connect to the server from the client. Turned SynCookies off in the server and flooded the server with the attacker. As soon as I did that, the client was no longer able to connect! Below is the code used for the tool called Flooder:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo flooder --dst 192.168.3.212 --highrate 100 --proto 6 --dportmin 80 --dportmax 80 --src 1.1.2.0 --srcmask 255.255.255.0
{% endhighlight %}
