### General Overview ###

###### Deep Learning Book

I do not think that this book will get done any time soon. This book specifically I am giving my self time throughout this quarter and next.

###### Tensor Flow Plug n Play

My goal is to have this done by end of March - end of April

###### Book Collection

My goal is to find out what books or data I can already get for my future program by end of April.

###### My own Nueral Network

I am hoping to accomplish this by end of May

###### Data Collection (Emotions and colors/words)

This will take a while to accumulate. I am thinking I may need to start this earlier, but would like to have this done by end of June.

###### Deep Learning Machine

I do not see this a reality but it is still a goal. I have no time frame.
