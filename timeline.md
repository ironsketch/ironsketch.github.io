## SOS Project Neural Networks

#### ¤ [Proposal](http://intmain.in/proposal/) ¤ [Timeline](http://intmain.in/timeline/) ¤ [Bibliography](http://intmain.in/bibliography/) ¤

##### May 24th [] #####

* Fix average distance from color word.

* Find a way to relate colors with emotions based on words?
* Find similarities from colors and emotions
* Find what books could be read based on the emotion it implies 'overall'

##### May 6th [✓] #####
 
* ~~Read [Lexical Co-occurrence, Statistical Significance, and Word Association](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D11-1098)~~
* ~~Fix math and add weighted average~~

##### Apr 29th [✓] #####
 
* ~~Disallow words farther than 5 spaces from color word.~~
* ~~Disallow words smaller than 3 letters and disallow specific 3 letter words~~.

##### ~~Apr 2nd [✓]~~ #####
 
* ~~Start creating my own Nueral Network, either through C++ or TensorFlow/Python. I must solidify my decision and actions by the beginning of Spring Quarter~~.

##### ~~Feb 28th []~~ #####
 
Create simple Nueral Network in C++

##### Feb 19th [✓] #####

Create a gist of a data using hash tables, trees etc. Colors and words (small) ✓
 
##### Jan 29th [✓] #####
 
Finish Website design ✓

### General Overview ###
 
###### Deep Learning Book
 
I do not think that this book will get done any time soon. This book specifically I am giving my self time throughout this quarter and next.

###### Tensor Flow Plug n Play

My goal is to have this done by end of March - end of April

###### Book Collection

My goal is to find out what books or data I can already get for my future program by end of April.

###### My own Nueral Network

I am hoping to accomplish this by end of May

###### Data Collection (Emotions and colors/words)

This will take a while to accumulate. I am thinking I may need to start this earlier, but would like to have this done by end of June.

###### Deep Learning Machine

I do not see this a reality but it is still a goal. I have no time frame.
