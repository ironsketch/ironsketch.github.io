I talked to the teacher about an idea I had to use the data structures we are using to make a simple silly relational network (would not call it a [neural network](#neural network)) But each word would have a % of use. Each color would have a percentage of use and compare... ? We will see. [Here](images/weirdidea-1.png) is an image of my abstract idea.

I started reading a book I got at a used bookstore. 'Mapping the Mind' by Rita Carter. It seemed interesting and it has important information on how neurons work. Which I have studied breifly in the past so it is good to relearn. Unfortunately this book talks about [Phrenology](#phrenology) as if it's legitimate. :( I fear for the world. [Phrenology History of a Pseudoscience](https://theness.com/index.php/phrenology-history-of-a-pseudoscience/)

Focused on MidTerms, little time to read. I added my first book/resource used to my Bibliography. My partner gave me new books to help out with this project if I can get to reading them, and a book to borrow. Languages and Machines to borrow, Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, and Foundations of Genetic Programming!

Today I set up my website again. I felt bad that it was not ready for class. I want to add a soft image to the background. I am pleased with the colors. I need to work on my bibliography. My goal is to have it be an official bibliography. But right now it's copy n paste. I would also like to see if I can't hone my timeline.. But that is less important to me as since this is such a huge project. I mostly want to go through the Deep Learning book since it will also force me to learn linear algebra amongst (I'm sure) many other things!

I started to go through the Deep Learning book. I am running through the introduction (worth it!). I was intrigued when it gave a real example of how [AI](#ai) fails. "It's inference engine detected an inconsistency in the story: it knew that people do not have electrical parts, but because Fred was holding an electric razor, it believed the entity "FredWhileShaving" contained electrical parts. It therefore asked whether Fred was still a person while he was shaving."
